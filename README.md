# Ava Source Code.
## Documentation doesn't exist
If you've been invited follow the next instructions. If (hackedWayIn == true) `return` msg.channel.send('have fun with this code, idk what you might use it for.');

### Instructions for people who were invited
#### Prerequisites: Computer (It would be great if it wasn't from the 1990's), JavaScript Knowledge, NodeJS 14.2.0 or greater installed, and some Discord.js knowledge.

So, you've been invited. Great! You now have access to all the source code for the Ava discord bot!<br>
Ok. To start off, clone this repo with the following:<br>
`git clone https://github.com/Julz4455/ava.git ava`<br>
<br>
I'm assuming you have this done. Now, you need to open the discord.js documentation on your computer or another computer. This is available here:<br>
[Discord.JS Documentation](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/general/welcome)
<br>
Anyways, after this is all done, just wait for instructions from the original developer if that is what he asked or you can start working on adding<br>new commands or even fixing bugs that you found. I also would love it if you make the bot more secure. The way I have it (May 8th, 2020) is very secure.

## Good Luck and Happy Hacking
